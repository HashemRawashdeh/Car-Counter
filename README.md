# Problem Statement
This project aims to address the challenge of accurately and efficiently counting the number of cars traversing a designated area. Conventional manual counting methods are known to be time-consuming, resource-intensive, and error-prone. Additionally, current automated systems may not offer the necessary level of precision or may entail exorbitant costs. Hence, the development of a dependable and cost-efficient system capable of utilizing sensors or cameras to precisely tally the volume of cars passing through a specific area is vital to cater to the requirements of transportation authorities, urban planners, and other pertinent stakeholders. The system should possess the capacity to distinguish between distinct types of vehicles, manage high traffic flows, and furnish real-time data for traffic supervision and planning objectives.
